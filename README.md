# Milestone-4
Updated Inventory Manager


For this assignment, I had to do something very similar to the previous Milestone. I had to create an inventory item class, with multiple methods.Methods that add to the inventory, delete from the inventory, restock the inventory, search for an item in the inventory, and display each item in the inventory.

The changes I had to make were to instead of using an Array to hold the inventory items, I had to use a List. I also had to change my interface so that it can manipulate the items in the inventory. I used button event handlers for that application. Finally, I had to in someway incorrperate two forms into this project. I simply one form as a cover page, and the second as the main form.

Challenges and more in depth explantion on my work will be in the transcript text file. At the beginning of the course, I had informed you that my audio would not work properly for screencast videos as they have not for other classes. Like the last assignment I have used a transcript.
